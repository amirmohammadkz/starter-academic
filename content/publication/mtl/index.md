abstract: In recent years, deep learning-based automated personality trait detection has received a lot of attention, especially now, due to the massive digital footprints of an individual. Moreover, many researchers have demonstrated that there is a strong link between personality traits and emotions. In this paper, we build on the known correlation between personality traits and emotional behaviors, and propose a novel multitask learning framework, SoGMTL that simultaneously predicts both of them. We also empirically evaluate and discuss different information-sharing mechanisms between the two tasks. To ensure the high quality of the learning process, we adopt a MAML-like framework for model optimization. Our more computationally efficient CNN-based multitask model achieves the state-of-the-art performance across multiple famous personality and emotion datasets, even outperforming Language Model based models.
